# Predictive Modeling and Simulation of Monocrystalline Photovoltaic (PV) Cells Using MATLAB/Simulink

This project presents a physics-based MATLAB/Simulink model of a monocrystalline photovoltaic (PV) cell. It simulates the electrical behavior of the cell under various environmental and physical conditions, including changes in solar irradiance, temperature, and internal resistance parameters. The project also implements a Perturb and Observe (P&O) Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm to optimize power extraction under dynamic weather conditions.
